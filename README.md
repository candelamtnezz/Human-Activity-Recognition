# Human-Activity-Recognition
Predicting Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) from wearable sensor data using machine learning models and feature engineering.

This repository contains an assignment focused on predicting Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) from wearable and smartphone sensor data. The project explores activity classification using machine learning models, evaluates model performance across activities, and applies feature engineering to identify minimal and informative sensor features. Preprocessing steps such as cleaning, imputation, and class imbalance handling are documented and analyzed.
